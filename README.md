# Movies-ETL

### Overview
This analysis focused on the ETL process of cleaning up data for the purpose of making it usable. In this process, multiple data sources were used to clean and merge data about the Movie industry and output into tables that could be more readily used for a Hackathon. This process also reitereated the code-refactoring process to run one comprehensive script on all the data.
